These folder contains different C/C++ examples of camera to pixelated animation projection. 

Basic examples are in videoArrayExamples directory. It has some translations of previously developed Python code.

More advanced animation and simple efficient games are in pixelArray directory. 

Folder waterfallOnCUDA has iterative steps with attempts to pass various functions in the code to CUDA and compute them on GPU. 
However, this approach didn't give satisfiable results and animation was rebuilt from scratch.
