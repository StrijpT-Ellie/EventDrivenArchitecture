This directory has different implementations of default camera input converted to a pixelated array. 
Various examples apply different animation effects, responsiveness to movement, etc. 

**camera2pixel.py** - This code converts the camera feed to a 20 by 20 grid of "pixels"
**flickeringParticles_grid.py** - Video projected to circles which flicker when the camera detects motion
**flickeringParticles_stronger.py** - More contrast added for better output on LED PCB wall 
**floatingParticles.py** - Particles move around and speed up when movement is detected (no grid) 
**longExposure_longerDelay.py** - longer delay than in longExposureDelay.py
**longExposureDelay.py** - imitates long exposure for camera stream to pixelated output with some delay 
**waterfallCircles.py** - Imitates waterfall effect on video from the camera
