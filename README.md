# EventDrivenArchitecture

## Overview
This repository contains prototypes and components of an AI event-driven architecture for controlling an LED 8-bit screen. The project includes several modes such as animations, drawing, games, and interactions with large language models (LLMs).

## Folder Structure
- **2D_eventDriven**: Development of a brick pong game with hand controller support.
- **C**: Various animations, movement detection, and pose/hand recognition on Jetson Nano. Includes snake and brick pong games implemented in C/C++.
- **Ellie_connected_v3**: Experimental and development scripts.
- **flaskServerWith3DEffects**: YOLOv9 object detection integrated to create video effects and animations.
- **ollamaToPixelatedLetters**: Python scripts for sending requests to the Ollama server and projecting responses in a pixelated font.
- **soundAndPersonRecognition**: Scripts for detecting sound levels and recognizing persons using a simple OpenCV model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **C/C++**
- **YOLOv9**
- **OpenCV**
